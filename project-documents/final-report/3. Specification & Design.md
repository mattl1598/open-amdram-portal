## Technology Choice
### Backend
For the webapps backend, I will be using the Python-based Flask micro-framework 
along with various associated libraries for connecting to the database, 
handling web-sockets, and verifying forms. I've chosen Flask for my backend as: 
I have lots of experience using it;it is lightweight and modular compared to 
alternatives like Django; it has great performance and has been used by many 
high-traffic websites such as Reddit, Netflix, Trivago, Patreon, AirBnB and 
Uber (see (https://stackshare.io/flask).

To serve the webapp, research was done into two different WSGI _(Web Server Gateway Interface)_ implementations to determine the best one to move forward with for deployment. The two implementations chosen for research were Gunicorn and uWSGI for how many deployment guides are available for them. 

In the research, Gunicorn was found to have fewer configuration settings than uWSGI which makes it simple to work with while not missing out on functionality as the options it is missing tend to focus on deployments aimed at a much larger amount of traffic than the clients site is going to experience. Some performance testing of various WSGI implementations has been done previously by a company called AppDynamics who have published their findings. In their testing, they noted that uWSGI had "Disappointedly (sic) poor results" in most of their tests which they put down to a broken release or misconfiguration. On the other hand, Gunicorn was found to be "A good, consistent performer for medium loads" which fits the use case of this project and its client perfectly. As this is solely for the deployment, this choice isn't a requirement for anyone who wishes to build upon the work done in this project or deploy it themselves but it is a recommendation to those who do.

The web-server itself was decided on based off the recommendation made in the documentation of Gunicorn ,the chosen WSGI implementation. As the _Deploying Gunicorn_ page states  "we strongly advise that you useÂ Nginx" and that it is the only web server they provide an example configuration file for, Nginx was chosen. Just as with the chosen WSGI, other alternatives are available to be used however it is recommended to use Nginx .

### Database
When planning the project, a couple of different database types were considered and explored. 
The main decision to make was choosing between a SQL or a NoSQL type database.

SQL type databases are heavily relationship oriented which aligns quite well with the data that the project will be storing, in particular the cast and crew archives for each show. Having the relationships formally defined within the database allows the front-end to easily query and display data with different views such as the cast that appeared in a show vs the shows that a cast member has appeared in.

On the other hand, a NoSQL type database are very high-performance and lack the formally defined schemas that can slow down development of SQL based projects which allows for on-the-fly data structure modifications when implementing a new feature in the project. The downside of NoSQL is that it lacks the relationship links that make restructuring data in SQL queries so easy and makes the NoSQL queries incredibly complicated. 

Another benefit of using an SQL type database is how well it integrates with the chosen backend framework, Flask. Flask is built with a dependency of SQLAlchemy, a module designed to simplify the construction of SQL queries in Python, which means that a lot of its premade helper classes will only work with an SQL database. This module also has a lot of helpful built in features such as its integrated User template which simplifies authentication and confirming which user account in particular is logged in.

The final decision for the database technology was to use an SQL type database due to the relational nature of the data, the complex queries, prior experience, and compatibility with other parts of the project. As for the particular SQL database service, PostgreSQL was chosen for its regular updates, open-source development and simplicity for deployment. In addition to this, the client already has a PostgreSQL database set up for some of the temporary features that were added to the existing website prior to the start of this project.

## Site Accessibility
One of the major considerations for the design of the User Interface is how accessible it is to everyone. The target demographic for the website has quite a wide range which makes it important that no group gets excluded from being able to use the website as intended. 

### Text Contrast

When choosing text colour for the site, it's important to consider the contrast ratio between the text and its background and to follow the guidelines set in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). For the WCAG 2.0 level AA, the minimum contrast ratio should be 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text and for WCAG 2.0 level AAA (the highest level), contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text is required. In designing the site, all text is set to conform to at least a level AA ratio with the majority of the site meeting the full AAA level requirements. 

### Font Size

For those who struggle with reading small text, no matter the contrast ratio, it is important to include a way to adjust the site wide font size to help with readability. To facilitate this, a 1x, 1.5x and 2x font size adjustment buttons are placed in the footer of the website for ease of access and provide font adjustments that track across every page automatically.

### Site Theme (Positive vs Negative Contrast)

In separate discussions with both the client and project supervisor, the issue of text contrast was brought up particularly the issue of age when reading text with positive contrast (white text on dark backgrounds) which causes blurring of the text in an effect called "Halation".  This effect significantly decreases reading comprehension speeds for older age groups (those aged 45+) which accounts for a large proportion of the theatre company patrons.

To improve the readability whilst still keeping the look and feel of the site up to date, an the site should automatically detect the users device theme and adjust itself accordingly, while also providing an option to change the theme manually within the accessibility section of the footer with a simple drop-down selection. Just like the font size adjustment, this manual change will also track across the entire website.


### Device Compatibility 
Since 2017, mobile devices have accounted for over half of all the web traffic worldwide (see figure) which means that designing a site to have mobile compatibility is no longer a "nice to have" whilst the desktop experience gets all the effort, it is now a requirement to build a working and tested layout specifically tailored for mobile devices alongside the desktop. Using responsive design aspects from CSS, the site detects the type of device and adjusts the layout and design automatically including a hamburger-style navigation menu to reduce screen clutter, vertically oriented elements to allow more words per line for faster reading comprehension, and larger fonts to adjust for the much higher Pixel Density found on mobile screens in comparison with desktop displays.
