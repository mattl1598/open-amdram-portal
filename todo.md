- ethics - include certificate survey

### survey drafting
- section for directors/producers 
  - would it be easier to directly post public show updates to the homepage?
  - would you like the website to forward cast and crew updates to anyone 
    involved in the show?
  - would being able to share the script, rehearsal schedule and other 
    resources via the website be easier than emails and various file sharing 
    sites?

- cast and crew section
  - do you have any objections to the cast and crew list being included in 
    the past shows pages
  - would you like a place on the website to find the most up-to-date 
    documents and resources about a current show (ie script, lyrics etc)
  - if your named changed for any reason, how would you prefer previous 
    credits to be shown?
    - exactly as it was on the programme
    - "New Name" (as "Old Name")
    - "Old Name" (now "New Name")

- start with db

### databases used
- Wikipedia: MySQL 
[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FAQ/Technical#What_software_is_used_to_run_Wikipedia?)
- IMDb: previously used SybaseSQL, Oracle then PostgreSQL before using a 
  proprietary db (likely still SQL or other relational).

- noSQL doesnt necessarily suit the dataset
