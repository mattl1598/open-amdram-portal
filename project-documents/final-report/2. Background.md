## The Wider Context of the Project
The client for this project is a local Amateur Dramatics group who find their current website, a site based on WordPress, to be lacking in features and tedious to update as all changes have to be done by the groups website admin which takes time.

The first issue to address is the tediousness of updating the public facing pages of the site. This includes notices about auditions as well as upcoming shows and events that the public are invited to. As previously said, the changes are currently managed by the site admin but to reduce their work load, the ability to update those parts of the site should be available to the director and producer of the show currently in production.

The theatre group also have trouble sharing files such as scripts between each other as frequent updates to the script mean that it's somewhat impractical to keep requesting the website be updated by the admin and the current solution of emailing updated copies to the cast and crew involved in a specific show means that there can be many differing versions of a single file floating around which often makes it difficult to find the most up-to-date copy, especially if someone gets left out of a group email. Sharing these files via the website, particularly in a password protected section is the best solution to this particular problem and the one that will be implemented in the project.

One of the biggest issues they have had with their current site is the discontinuation of Picasa (a photo storage service which was bought by Google in 2004 and kept running until 2016*) which saw the loss of all the embedded photo galleries which showcased stills from the groups previous shows. With the end of Picasa, all the photos were safely transferred to albums stored on Google Photos but the gallery feature of Picasa was never implemented again, as such, the clients site lost the majority of its photo elements and there is not a simple way to display them again. In the project, there will be a way to integrate the Google Photos API into a simple gallery element on each page.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasa

Alongside the issues with photos, the past shows pages lack a lot of information about each show, sometimes as much as there not being a page in place for many of them. The pages that do exist are all static pages on the WordPress CMS which makes maintaining the photos and content on each page a far more arduous process than necessary. The project will consolidate all the information about each show, including records of cast and crew, into a database for dynamically generating pages for each show from a template which reduces the maintenance cost and helps with integrating the photos back into the site.

## Project Constraints
One of the project constraints is how the photos are stored. Currently, the group stores all the photos for each show on Google Photos with an already established workflow for uploading new photos. This means that the project will have to integrate with the Google Photos API in its new implementation of a gallery while still being accessible to the public. 

Another constraint is the accessibility of the site. The demographic of the theatre groups patrons, and therefore most of the sites traffic, is quite wide so considerations must be made in making sure the site is usable on all modern devices, i.e. computer, phones and tablets, and that content is suitably clear for everyone to read regarding contrast levels and font size.

## Technical Capabilities
For deployment, the client needs the site to be capable of keeping up with the same level of traffic as their current WordPress based site. 

Unfortunately, the clients current website provider doesn't have any traffic analytics available for getting the true rates from. Luckily, a baseline from their Google Business Profile and Facebook page redirects can be used to estimate a rough for what the project has to be able to support.

Looking at stats between the 1st of January 2022 and the 30th of April 2022, Facebook posts have 360 engagements and Google reports 142 website clicks through the Business profile (not from search results). This gives us a baseline of about 4 clicks per day which is not too intensive but this is just average traffic from just 2 sources. During the lead up to the performances of a show, site traffic is expected to surge with a typical pantomime run selling over 600 tickets which is all directed through the website.

With the new photos feature, the actual web-server is likely to experience at least 200 requests per second during busier periods so that needs to be taken into account when deciding on a technology to use. Luckily most web-servers, frameworks and reverse-proxies are built to handle as much load as they can especially within a production vs a development environment which means that, other than making a particularly bad decision, the choice can be decided based upon other factors like prior experience and ease of use. It has to be mentioned that these traffic estimations only account for legitimate traffic and the web-server must be capable of handling all extra loads from crawlers and bots.

The site also needs to be quick to load. The current website has a noticeable delay in the loading of each page which detracts from the overall user experience. This is another area in which the development tools and technology choices need to be made carefully to keep up with the browser in order to result in as short a delay as possible.

## Similar Existing Solutions.

### WordPress
The clients current website is running on a WordPress backend which is great for handling mostly static content with the functionality built-in for a blog, however over 130 similarly designed static pages is a very inefficient way to store the data from the past shows when that is an ideal use case for storing in a database. 

A stock (unmodified) WordPress installation also has no support for a restricted access area nor a file sharing feature without storing the files as static media elements which are features that the client has requested.

Lastly, modifying a WordPress page requires knowledge of HTML and CSS if anything more than basic text formatting is wanted which is a big ask of an entire diverse theatre group which results in the group having one member acting as a website administrator who updates the site on request by email. There's also an issue of regulating access if everyone in the group has access to the WordPress edit feature when only the director and producer of the upcoming/current shows need to be able to post announcements about it and this functionality is also lacking in WordPress.

### Blackboard Learn
One similar project is Blackboard Learn, a "web-based virtual learning environment and learning management system". This software is used by many universities to deliver learning materials to their students with content separated by course modules as well as providing announcements with any course related information, e.g. lecture dates and times.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_Learn

Their project is similar in a few ways. 

The way content is shared in Blackboard Learn is similar to the file sharing feature that will be included in this project however their implementation is intended for handling a much larger amount of content as well as being targeted at students means they have a higher margin for complexity whilst still being usable by their main demographic. Theatre groups have members from a variety of backgrounds with many levels of technical ability so the interface for finding and downloading a file must be simple enough that anyone can do it.

The way content is organised by course modules in Blackboard Learn is very similar to how this project will separate resources by show. Their implementation is largely what inspired the organisational aspect of this project.

Whilst similar to this project, Blackboard Learn is not an applicable solution for the clients needs as its focus on catering to large universities means there are many features that the client has no use for, like the ability to conduct assessments, and the pricing of it ("$9,500 USD per year") puts it well out of reach to the client. Blackboard Learn also lacks much of the unrestricted site functionality that the client needs for the public facing side of their website meaning they would need a second product to cater to that, costing even more money.

### IMDb
Another similar project is IMDb, the Internet Movie Database. This project stores the data from "over 8 million movies, TV series, and video game titles" and connects those to the roles that "over 11 million cast and crew" had in each including photos for the shows, descriptions and more. One of the features the client wants is a complete overhaul of their old Show Archive page which utilised static pages for each show. IMDb is a great comparison just on a different scale and dataset to what was requested. https://developer.imdb.com/

Once again, IMDb has been a great source of inspiration for this project as provides a great example for the user interface and how browsing shows, cast, and crew could work in this project. It also gives a great list of attributes that should be stored about any individual show, particularly for things with which to use to sort, group or filter the shows.

Even though it is such a great example, IMDb is closed source, proprietary site which means it can't be adapted or even deployed on a small scale for the show archive which necessitates a solution be made from scratch. Even if it were available to deploy, it would lack the restricted web-portal aspect of this project which is one of the major features requested by the client.
