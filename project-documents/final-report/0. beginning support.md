## Abstract
A small Amateur Dramatics group reached out needing a new website incorporating photo galleries that fetched from their existing storage service, a full archive of the details surrounding their previous productions and a secure portal with which to share resources and announcements regarding upcoming shows. This project also works on the challenge of keeping webpages loading quickly while still delivering hundreds of photos in a single gallery. This paper covers the initial research into existing solutions followed by the development of this new website and portal along with the challenges faced and approaches used when implementing all the requested features.
