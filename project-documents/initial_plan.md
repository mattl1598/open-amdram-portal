## Project Description
This project is centered around building custom website features for a client, more specifically 
an Amateur Dramatics group. The groups current website is deployed using WordPress which lacks 
proper implementation of a few features that they need. Currently, their website uses available 
features to create approximations of the desired behaviours but that makes it hard to maintain 
and update, especially as some pages have been broken by deprecated dependencies. 

The main development aims of the project are:
- Custom Image Gallery for Google Photos images.
- Improved Show Archive page with full show details.
- Blog page and editor.
- Members only web-portal

My personal aims for the project are:
- Practise writing code for a production environment rather than prototypes.
- Improve writing documentation for a project.

## Project Aims and Objectives

- Custom Image Gallery
  - To replace the broken Picasa galleries on the current website
  - Load images from the clients Google Photos storage
- IMDb-style Show Archive 
  - Consolidate data from individual web pages and old show programmes into a database.
  - Store and display over 130 past shows spread across 47 years.
  - include cast & crew and ability to see which shows a person was in.
- Blog Page
  - Posts stored in database
  - intuitive editor (WYSIWYG)
  - ability to upload and convert Word documents
- Members only web-portal
  - Resource sharing
  - rehearsal/event scheduling
  - announcement collation
