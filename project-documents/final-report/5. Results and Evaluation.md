## Results
One of the objective aims of the project was to reduce the webpage loading times compared to the clients previous solution. The statistics that follow were generated from desktop based tests however similar differences between the two solutions do occur on mobile tests as well and the full table of results can be found below.

The previous WordPress based system would take over 700ms for the first byte of data to make it to the browser which creates a significant lack of responsiveness when browsing the site. In the new solution, the server responds with the first byte in under 100ms which results in a much faster feeling site.
