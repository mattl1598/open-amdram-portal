The main aims of the project have been successfully met when it comes to the functionality of the solution however there are some small areas of improvement that have been identified regarding the styling of a few of the webpages. In addition to the styling, there are definitely some areas of code that can be cleaned up and consolidated to make the back end of the site even more lightweight. In spite of these aspects that will be improved upon in future work, the project is fully functional and could be deployed as the clients full time public facing website within a very short time frame, most of which would be spent reconfiguring their domain name to point to the new site. This project does admittedly need some improvement before it's truly usable by the client for the web portal section but those changes are minor and don't require much, if any, functionality changes.

In conclusion, although the solution is not fully polished, it does include the majority of the high priority features that were discussed in the initial plan. I believe that the project has the fundamentals of a unique website and web portal that will become increasingly more important in the clients future productions as more and more of their members start to use it.
