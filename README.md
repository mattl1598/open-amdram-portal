# Open Am-Dram Portal

Welcome to the Open Am-Dram Portal project! 
This project is an open-source website and portal for Amateur Dramatics groups. 
It was initially developed as part of a university dissertation project that 
was awarded a first-class grade but is still undergoing further development as it
gets rolled out to its first client.
