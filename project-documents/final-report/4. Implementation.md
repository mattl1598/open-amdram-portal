## Database
To store the details about a particular show, a *Show* table was created with the expected attributes like "title", "genre" and some date attributes. The id field of the *Show* table is then used to link together any other table that contains show related information such as any files being shared, announcements/update posts for the website and the photos to be displayed on in the "Show Archive" section of the site.

The *ShowPhotos* table is used to help reduce the number of API calls made to Google Photos by storing the image identifier string for making a direct request when it gets displayed on the website. This was the best approach to storing the photos as is outlined in the section on how the Google Photos API is implemented.

The *User* table is handled a little bit differently to most webapps as its used to group together the *Member* entries for people who have performed under different names (changing their last name when they got married etc) and not every performer may need to be able to log into the website (those who have moved away and left the group or passed on) but consolidating all these possible use cases into various states of the *User* table simplifies the database schema and helps reduce the complexity of any queries involving people. 

The *Posts* table handles all of the public announcements, auditions notices and the private posts that only get shared with authenticated users. It stores the basic data needed to distinguish and display the posts in the right locations on the site. 

Similar to the *Posts* table, the *BlogPost* table contains the data for the blog that a members of client theatre group runs. This table has been brought over from the temporary blog that was set up on their previous site while this project was in development. Considering the similarity between the *BlogPost* and *Post* tables, this is one of the areas identified for improvement in the Future Work section.

The *Members* table stores a list of all the names that appear in any programmes as cast or crew and links them to a *User* account if there are multiple names for one person. Using this table also allows for members who don't need a full *User* profile to still be included in the Show Archives.

Connecting *Members* with the *Shows* they are in is done in the *MemberShowLink* table. This table connects the member_id and show_id and also contains more information about what role that member had in that particular show and whether or not they were part of the cast or the crew as to separate those when listing them on in the show archives. Being able to link a role back to the *User* account will allow a member to update their personal details such that their name can always be correct on the site. In the case where the name on a programme differs from that stored in the associated *User* account, the account name is shown with the older record being shown along side in a style inspired by IMDb.

There are also a handful of small tables that only store a small amount of data.  The *KeyValue* table is a simple variable storage section for handling persistent options that need to be kept after a server restart. The *BlogImage* table stores the images uploaded in the blogs which are served alongside the text content. The *Files* table stores files like scripts that are being shared for each show.

## Google Photos API
In implementing the code that links the show archives to the photos that the client has stored on their Google Photos account, a variety of issues were faced.

### API Authentication with OAuth 
The first issue that came up when interfacing with the Photos API was the lack of support for any "server to server" communication methods. Most of Googles APIs have 3 modes of authentication, an API key, a "Service Account", and using OAuth, the former two are aimed at server-side applications whereas the latter is for client-side ones. For this project, a lot of the logic is handled on the server-side to reduce load times, so either the API key or a service account would have been the ideal authentication method however the specific Google Photos API only supports OAuth (the reason why is outlined below). This limitation meant that updating the photos on the site has to be performed by someone with access to the clients Google account and needs actual user input in order to perform the authentication which makes it harder to perform API queries in the background.

The reason OAuth is the only supported API authentication method is because the data in Google Photos that gets exposed when authenticated is always of a sensitive nature as its entirely user generated content as opposed to published publicly accessible data like that of the Google Books API. OAuth ensures that the owner of the account being accessed has given permission to the application and creates transparency around what permissions have been requested from the user. 

### BaseURL Expiry Documentation
In my first attempt to store photos in the database without keeping all of the raw data for each image, I tried to store the BaseURL, an endpoint on Googles servers that returns the image associated with the link. In initial testing, this performed really well and successfully displayed the images on the site. When demonstrating the site in a meeting with the project supervisor, the images stopped loading with no apparent reason. 

After nearly a day of investigating the unexplained 403 Forbidden errors, the issue was identified as the image BaseURL only being valid for 1 hour from generation. This feature is not properly documented in the pages about the API results in which BaseURLs are returned which makes it a particularly hard issue to track down. 

### Re-Authenticating without an OAuth Pop-up 
One issue with not being able to store BaseURLs for images is that getting any images will always require an API call which necessitates finding a method for getting it authenticated without going through the full OAuth access request.

When authenticating through OAuth, a successful login will return an "Access Token" which will authenticate any API call its included with for the next hour. This token does have an expiry time which means that it is not suitable for using when getting the images for the site as that would require an OAuth login once an hour. 

Fortunately, there is a parameter that can be added to the initial OAuth login that will generate a "Refresh Token" alongside the "Access Token". This new "Refresh Token" allows an application to make another request to Googles authentication servers to generate a new "Access Token" with the need for user input. These "Refresh Tokens" do technically expire and can be manually revoked by the account holder but the expiration only happens after 6 months of in-activity which is usually won't happen on a publicly available website. 

### The Final Implementation
In the end, the optimum solution of those that worked was to store the permanent ID attribute of each photo that needs to be displayed in the database which can then be used to generate a new BaseURL through the Photos API. This does require an API call per photo being loaded on a webpage but the additional loading times from API calls can be mitigated with other load time reductions, one of which is written about in detail below.


## Fast Photo Gallery
### Problem: Loading Many Images Quickly
As the client has over 200 photos attached to each of their shows and to load all of those images as the page loads takes over 10 seconds or even much longer on a mobile connection. Obviously, this is not the best user experience so some optimisation must be done to reduce the time each page takes to load in.

### Solution: Loading In Advance
In order to facilitate an apparent instant loading of the images in the gallery without spending an eternity preloading each of them, the gallery element must be capable of fetching the next image in the queue as it gets requested by the user without showing a blank space while the image data is being downloaded. 

By preloading just 5 of the images when the webpage loads, the gallery can use 2 images either side of the currently displaying one as a form of buffer with loaded images that can be displayed instantly to the user while the next unloaded image along the array gets loaded in the background. The images are loaded on either side of the starting one as the gallery supports wraparound view (ie going from image 1/200 straight to 200/200 by clicking the left arrow). Figure X shows a graphic representation of a 10 image gallery and which images get loaded when being navigated in either direction.

By using more than one image as the buffer, the user is less likely to see a gap if one image is particularly slow to load in for any reason while still keeping the initial load time for the page to a minimum.
