### Measurable Results
One of the measurable aims of the project was to reduce the webpage loading times compared to the clients previous solution. The statistics that follow were generated from desktop based tests however similar differences between the two solutions do occur on mobile tests as well and the full table of results can be found below.

The previous WordPress based system would take over 700ms for the first byte of data to make it to the browser which creates a significant lack of responsiveness when browsing the site. In the new solution, the server responds with the first byte in under 100ms which results in a much faster feeling site. 

### Project Objectives
One of the most ambitious parts of the project was creating a Show Archives feature similar to IMDb. The functionality of this feature was successfully implemented and is capable of showing all the shows from the database, the cast and crew members involved in each show and the photos taken for each show. The cast and crew lists for each show also provide links to a page for each member that will list all of the shows they have been credited in.

Due to the limited time scale of this project, some of the styling around the cast and crew lists is not quite at the level of polish that a fully finished version would have but improving the look is something that can be done in future work rather than having to sacrifice features to make what is left look nice.
